Hello! My name is Yiqing Li, currently a research associate at Machine Learning Department of Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), supervised by Professor [Kun Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/index.html). Before that, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) in China, majoring in Data Science and Big Data Technology. I also spent time at the University of Melbourne under the supervision of [Mingming Gong](https://mingming-gong.github.io/) in 2023.

### Research Interests

I am currently interested in the intersection of Machine Learning and Causality, with a particular focus on Causal Discovery and Causal Representation Learning. I am also open to exploring Reinforcement Learning and Large Language Models.
