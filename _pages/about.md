Hello! My name is Yiqing Li, currently a research associate at Machine Learning Department of Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), supervised by Professor <u><a href="{{https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/index.html}}">Kun Zhang</a>.</u>
Before that, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from <u><a href="{{https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/}}">Fudan University</a></u> in China, majoring in Data Science and Big Data Technology. I also spent time at the University of Melbourne under the supervision of <u><a href="{{https://mingming-gong.github.io/}}">Mingming Gong</a></u> in 2023.

### Research Interests

I am currently interested in the intersection of Machine Learning and Causality, with a particular focus on Causal Discovery and Causal Representation Learning. I am also open to exploring Reinforcement Learning and Large Language Models.
